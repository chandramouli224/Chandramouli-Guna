I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at Brightflag. I focus on developing and maintaining cutting-edge machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to enhance business insights and automation. My role extends beyond model development to implementing MLOps best practices, ensuring scalable, reliable, and efficient deployment of ML models. I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at HostelWorld where my primary expertise revolved around Machine Learning, recommender systems, and Google Ads, with a particular emphasis on Natural Language Processing. I possess a profound interest in these domains and continuously strive to enhance my skills in the areas of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. If you wish to get in touch with me, please feel free to reach out at [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandramouli-guna-79a16095/). I welcome any opportunities for collaboration, discussion, or inquiries related to my work in the areas of Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
